/**
 * This class is used to aggregate the MSODRAWING and OBJ record
 * combinations.  This is necessary due to the bizare way in which
 * these records are serialized.  What happens is that you get a
 * combination of MSODRAWING -&gt; OBJ -&gt; MSODRAWING -&gt; OBJ records
 * but the escher records are serialized _across_ the MSODRAWING
 * records.
 * <p>
 * It gets even worse when you start looking at TXO records.
 * <p>
 * So what we do with this class is aggregate lazily.  That is
 * we don't aggregate the MSODRAWING -&gt; OBJ records unless we
 * need to modify them.
 * <p>
 * At first document contains 4 types of records which belong to drawing layer.
 * There are can be such sequence of record:
 * <p>
 * DrawingRecord
 * ContinueRecord
 * ...
 * ContinueRecord
 * ObjRecord | TextObjectRecord
 * .....
 * ContinueRecord
 * ...
 * ContinueRecord
 * ObjRecord | TextObjectRecord
 * NoteRecord
 * ...
 * NoteRecord
 * <p>
 * To work with shapes we have to read data from Drawing and Continue records into single array of bytes and
 * build escher(office art) records tree from this array.
 * Each shape in drawing layer matches corresponding ObjRecord
 * Each textbox matches corresponding TextObjectRecord
 * <p>
 * ObjRecord contains information about shape. Thus each ObjRecord corresponds EscherContainerRecord(SPGR)
 * <p>
 * EscherAggrefate contains also NoteRecords
 * NoteRecords must be serial
